# Notices for the sample buildings

Ara 3D's code in this repository is MIT licensed (`LICENSE` at the root). The sample notebooks in `samples/notebooks` hold results computed from three openly licensed buildings: table snapshots, counts, and charts, plus graph documents that name the buildings' files. The buildings themselves are not in this repository. They come from BIM Open Data (https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-data), whose `samples/public` folder `node deps.mjs` puts at `deps/bim-open-data/samples/public`; a notebook's live 3D view loads a `.bos` file from there through the host.

The building data keeps its own licence. Each section below is a copy of the section of the same name in BIM Open Data's `samples/public/NOTICE.md`, so its file names are relative to that folder (and, for the Duplex's IFC files, to that repository). `test/notice.test.ts` in `bimopenflow/web/packages/bim-open-notebook` fails when a copy drifts from the pinned BIM Open Data, or when a sample graph names a file no section lists.

What was changed, for every file: each source IFC file was read by BIM Open Data's IFC loader and written out as BIM Open Schema tables, then loaded into a DuckDB database with text views (BIM Open Data's notice has the details). The sample notebooks add only queries over those tables; nothing in the building data was edited.

`samples/nrc/duplex-base.ifc` is that file unchanged (the same SHA-256, `b347a2c8…606ed`). `samples/nrc/duplex-enriched.ifc` is that file with analytics property sets added for the NRC (National Research Council Canada) paper.
